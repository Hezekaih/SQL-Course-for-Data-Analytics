# Intoduction

## Background: Technical Process Documentation:

## Objective: Generate a dataset and integrate it into Microsoft SQL Server for sales analysis at Astroidegita Store.

## Data Generation with Python Faker:
Utilized Python's Faker library to generate realistic sales data.
Created a Python script to generate data with the following columns: Order_Id, Customer_Id, Gender, Age, Date, Qty, City, Status, Channel, SKU, Category, Amount, Ship_City.
Limited the dataset to 5000 rows.

## Integration with SQL Server:
To leverage the power of SQL Server for advanced analytics, I seamlessly integrated the generated dataset into our database. Leveraging the pyodbc module, 
I established a connection to our SQL Server, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer. Utilizing Windows Authentication, 
I authenticated our connection, maintaining data security without the need for explicit credentials.

Installed pyodbc module to facilitate connectivity with SQL Server.
Configured the connection string to specify the server, database, and authentication method (Windows Authentication).
Established a connection to the SQL Server using pyodbc.connect() method.
Created a table in SQL Server to store the sales data if it didn't exist already.
Inserted the generated data into the SQL Server table using cursor.execute() method and SQL INSERT INTO statement.
Handled any encountered errors during the integration process, such as login failures or table creation issues.

## Testing and Validation:

Conducted thorough testing to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data after integration.
Executed SQL queries to verify the data was successfully inserted into the SQL Server table.
Validated that the data in the SQL Server table matches the original generated dataset.

## Challenges and Solutions:

During the integration process, I encountered challenges such as login failures due to misconfigured connection parameters. 
Through troubleshooting and consultation, I resolved these issues, ensuring a smooth and successful integration process.
